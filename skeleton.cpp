// as per name this code is the skeleton code syntax in c++
#include<iostream> 
// header file same as in c language contains packages or functions like cout and many more and preprocessor directive used to include files , iostream used for taking input and printing output

using namespace std;
 //means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library

int main()
// main function where the compiler read first 
{
    cout << "NEW JOURNEY\n" << endl;
    // cout is the command for printing the message on screen and the syntax is used above with endl (used for separating the lines) and \n used to addds line break

    return 0; 
    // return function should be written in main function because we use int before main() and if we use void we don't have to write return function and exit status of a function and return fucntion if we write anything that will not read by compiler
