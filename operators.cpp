/* operators in c++ (false = 0 and true = 1)
1. arithmetic 
  a. binary operators = +,-,*,/,%
  b. unary operator = ++,--
   increment operator(++)
   post(a++) and pre(++a)
   in post if b = a++ then value of a incremented but the value of b is same as a before incremented 
   in pre if b = ++a the value of b and a is same because first a is incremented then assign to b
   same as with decrementer(--)
2. relational 
   == - gives true value if both operands have equal value
   != - gives true if both operands are not equal
   > - gives true if left operands is more than right operand 
   < - gives true if left operands is less than right operand 
   >= - gives true if left operand is more than ir equal to right operand
   <= - gives true if left operand is less than ir equal to right operand  
3. logical 
   && = AND gives us true if both operands are true , else false
   || = OR gives us true if at least one if the operand are true
   ! = NOT gives the opposite logical value of the operand . true becomes false and false becomes true 
4. bitwise 
   AND , OR , XOR , LEFT SHIFT , RIGHT SHIFT
5. assignment 
   =,+=,-=,*=,/=
6. miscellaneous
   sizeof() = return the size of the variable
   condition?X:Y (ternary/conditional operator) = returns value of X if condition is true or else value of Y{int a ,b then c = a>b?a-b:b-a}
   cast = convert one datatype to another
   comma(,) = causes a sequence of operation to be performed
   & = return the address of a variable
   * = pointer to a variable
